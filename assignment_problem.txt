Based on datasets: patient, mortality, OutpatientVisit, and DiseaseMap answer the below questions with R.

Are women more likely to die than men in this group of patients?
Assume people without a date of death in the mortality table are still alive.

Calculate the mortality rate for every year between 2005 and 2018.
Is it generally increasing or decreasing?
Assume patients are only at risk of death as of their first visit (in the outpatient visit file).
Once they have died, they are no longer at risk in subsequent year.
